# English learning game box  

This is a mobile app, that I created just when played with React Native. 

## Motivation

In English classes, we often need to get a random set of letters to make words out of them. Every time searching the Internet for such an application is tiring. So the idea came up to create a mobile application that will always be at hand.  
Later, I also added the Coin Flip mini app.

## How it looks?

There are two mini apps:  
- Coin Flip
- Letters generator

## Coin Flip

Coin Flip looks like this:  

<img src="https://github.com/victorizbitskiy/elgb/blob/main/docs/img/Coin%20flip.gif"/>  

There are 12 GIFs that are shown randomly.  
To determine how long the animation takes, the [gifs.json](https://github.com/victorizbitskiy/elgb/blob/main/src/modules/coinFlip/gifs/gifs.json) file is used.

## Letters generator

Letters generator looks like this:  

<img src="https://github.com/victorizbitskiy/elgb/blob/main/docs/img/Letters%20generator.gif"/>  

Here we can set the number of letters and the number of groups.

## How to run it?

Clone it:
```
git clone https://github.com/victorizbitskiy/elgb
```
Install dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```
Then run it and then press `w`:
```
$ expo start
```
